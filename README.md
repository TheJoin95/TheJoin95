### Hi, I'm Miki 👋👨‍💻

I'm a passionate software engineer, an endless curious and an endless student.
<br/>I love the opensource world, building community, share my knowledge, speaking at conferences and learn every day.

Actually I'm based in Florence, Italy. I'm working as a Fullstack engineer and researcher [@ plansoft-it](https://github.com/plansoft-it)

🗣 Usually I make some talks about technology, design patterns, DDD and architecture... serious stuff, bruh. You can find the slides on [Slideshare](https://www.slideshare.net/MikiLombardi)

📋 I'm also writing some articles on [Medium](https://medium.com/@miki.lombi). They are about my experience, experiments and other tech stuff

⚡ I'm currently a founder and a speaker at [Schrödinger Hat](https://github.com/Schrodinger-Hat), an italian live stream / podcast, talking about software development, sharing knowledges


You can find me anywhere, just talk about me... I will appear at you ❤️
